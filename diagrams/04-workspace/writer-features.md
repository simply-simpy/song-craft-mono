# Writer Features

## Metadata Capture (during or right after a session)

- Song info: working title, alternate titles, tempo, key
- Writer info: full legal name, email, phone, PRO affiliation, IPI number, publisher name
- Session info: date, time, location/Zoom link, participants
- Notes field: inspirations, references, intended artist/placement
- ðŸ‘‰ This ensures the song can be registered immediately with PROs/publishers without extra admin

## Versioning & Ownership History

- Every save = a version snapshot of lyrics/chords
  - auto save vs 'save a version'
- "Final" versions tagged by the writers
- Ownership chain: if song is sold/transferred, history stays intact
- Useful for disputes, publisher delivery commitments, and catalog audits

## Writer Credits & Roles

- Not all contributors are equal:
  - Owner (full rights, can invite/manage)
  - Co-writer (split share)
  - Producer/Topliner (songwriting vs. production contributions marked separately)
  - Lyricist / Composer tags (useful for classical, musical theatre, or film scoring contexts)
- ðŸ‘‰ This allows exports that match industry norms (where credits often distinguish lyricist vs composer)

## Split Sheet Extensions

- Business Entities: splits can go to an LLC or publisher, not just an individual
- Publishing share mapping: Writer A â†’ ASCAP, Writer B â†’ BMI, Writer C â†’ SESAC
- Multiple publishers per writer (e.g., co-pub deals)
- ðŸ‘‰ This matches reality â€” and avoids bottlenecks when registering songs

## Task & Delivery Management

- Reminders for publisher delivery quotas (e.g., "3 of 10 songs delivered this term")
- Automatic generation of delivery packets: lyric sheet, demo mp3, split sheet PDF, contact sheet
- Submission logging: who delivered, when, to whom

## Collaboration Tools

- Lyric editor with attribution (like Google Docs â†’ track changes + who wrote each line)
- Comment threads pinned to sections
- Realtime chords/structure map (verse/chorus/bridge blocks)
- Integrated file storage: demo mp3, stems, lyric PDFs all tied to the song record
- Key change for chords
