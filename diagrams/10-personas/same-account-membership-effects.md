## How This Affects Their Workflow

## Potential Challenges

### **1. Privacy Concerns**

- **All songs visible**: Writers might want some songs to be private
- **All contributions visible**: Writers might want to hide some work
- **All activity visible**: Writers might want some activities private

### **2. Permission Conflicts**

- **Only Riley can create songs**: Other writers might want to create songs
- **Only Riley can manage splits**: Other writers might want to manage their own splits
- **Only Riley can invite**: Other writers might want to invite collaborators

### **3. Creative Conflicts**

- **Different creative visions**: Writers might have different artistic directions

- **Different priorities**: Writers might have different project priorities

## Solutions and Workarounds

### **1. Project-Level Organization**

- **Create separate projects** within Pop Division for different creative directions
- **Use projects** to group related songs and collaborators
- **Use projects** to manage different timelines and priorities

### **2. Song-Level Permissions**

- **Use song ACLs** to grant specific permissions on individual songs
- **Use song authors** to track who contributed to which songs
- **Use song access** to share songs with specific writers

### **3. Role Management**

- **Promote writers to owners** if they need more control
- **Create custom roles** for specific needs
- **Use account managers** to handle day-to-day operations

## The Bottom Line

**Being in the same account creates a unified team experience** where:

- **All writers share the same business context** (Sony Music Pop Division)
- **All writers can collaborate on the same songs** and projects
- **All writers are subject to the same contract terms** and policies
- **All writers contribute to the same account goals** and objectives

**The key insight**: Accounts create **team boundaries** rather than **individual boundaries**. All members of an account are part of the same team, working toward the same goals, under the same business terms.

This is why the unified song view makes sense - when you're in an account, you're part of a team, and you should be able to see and collaborate on all the team's work.
