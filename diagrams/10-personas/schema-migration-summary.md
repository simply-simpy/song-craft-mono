# Schema Migration Complete - Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**

- ✅ Created new association tables:
  - `song_project_associations` (0 records)
  - `project_account_associations` (4 records)
  - `session_song_associations` (0 records)
  - Enhanced `song_account_links` (20,013 records)

- ✅ Created new settings tables:
  - `org_settings` (6 records)
  - `account_settings` (8 records)
  - `project_settings` (4 records)
  - `song_settings` (0 records)
  - `user_settings` (0 records)

- ✅ Enhanced existing association tables:
  - `song_account_links` - Added `association_type` and `updated_at`
  - `song_authors` - Added `split_percentage`, `territory_rights`, `updated_at`

### **2. Data Migration**

- ✅ Migrated 20,013 song-account relationships to `song_account_links`
- ✅ Migrated 4 project-account relationships to `project_account_associations`
- ✅ Created default settings for existing orgs, accounts, and projects

### **3. Schema Cleanup**

- ✅ Removed old parent-child foreign key columns:
  - `songs.account_id` ❌
  - `songs.project_id` ❌
  - `projects.account_id` ❌
  - `sessions.project_id` ❌
  - `lyric_versions.account_id` ❌

### **4. RLS Policy Updates**

- ✅ Updated Row Level Security policies to use association tables
- ✅ Songs and lyric_versions now use `song_account_links` for access control
- ✅ Projects and sessions now use `project_account_associations` for access control

## ⚠️ **NEXT STEPS REQUIRED**

### **1. API Code Updates**

The API code still references the old `account_id` and `project_id` columns that were removed. Need to update:

- **Song Service** (`src/services/songs.service.ts`):
  - Remove `accountId` and `projectId` from `songResponseSchema`
  - Update `createSong` to use `song_account_links` instead of direct `account_id`
  - Update `listSongs` to join with association tables
  - Update `updateSong` to work with associations

- **Song Repository** (`src/repositories/song.repository.ts`):
  - Update queries to join with `song_account_links` and `song_project_associations`
  - Remove references to `account_id` and `project_id` columns

- **Project Service** (`src/services/project.service.ts`):
  - Update to use `project_account_associations` instead of direct `account_id`

- **Search Service** (`src/services/search.service.ts`):
  - Update to work with association tables

### **2. Frontend Updates**

- Update API response types to match new schema
- Update components that expect `accountId` and `projectId` on songs
- Update search functionality to work with associations

### **3. Testing**

- Test song creation with new association model
- Test song listing with account context
- Test search functionality
- Test project management

## **Current Status**

- ✅ Database schema successfully migrated to association model
- ✅ Data successfully migrated to association tables
- ✅ RLS policies updated to use associations
- ⚠️ API code needs updates to work with new schema
- ⚠️ Frontend code needs updates to work with new API responses

## **Migration Statistics**

```
Association Tables:
- song_account_links: 20,013 records
- song_project_associations: 0 records
- project_account_associations: 4 records
- session_song_associations: 0 records

Settings Tables:
- org_settings: 6 records
- account_settings: 8 records
- project_settings: 4 records
- song_settings: 0 records
- user_settings: 0 records
```

The database migration is **100% complete**. The next phase is updating the application code to work with the new association-based model.
