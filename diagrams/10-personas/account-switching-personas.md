### Background

- 38-year-old music industry veteran
- Manages 5+ artists across different labels
- Each artist has separate publishing deals and account structures
- Needs to maintain clear separation between artist projects
- Handles licensing, royalties, and project coordination

### Account Switching Needs

**Why Account Switching is Critical:**

- **Label Separation**: Each artist's work must stay within their label's account
- **Publishing Rights**: Different publishing deals require separate account contexts
- **Royalty Tracking**: Accurate attribution requires proper account isolation
- **Client Confidentiality**: Artists' work must remain private to their respective accounts

### Typical Workflow

1. **Morning Setup**: Switches to Artist A's account (Universal Music)
2. **Project Management**: Reviews songs, schedules sessions, manages collaborators
3. **Midday Switch**: Switches to Artist B's account (Sony Music)
4. **Different Context**: Works on different genre, different collaborators, different timeline
5. **Evening Switch**: Switches to Artist C's account (Independent label)
6. **Context Reset**: Different budget, different creative constraints, different goals

### Pain Points Without Account Switching

- **Data Mixing**: Songs from different artists getting mixed up
- **Permission Confusion**: Wrong collaborators seeing wrong projects
- **Royalty Errors**: Incorrect attribution leading to payment disputes
- **Client Trust**: Artists losing confidence due to privacy breaches

### Account Switching Benefits

- **Efficient Workflow**: Quick context switching without confusion

### Open Questions

- Does Jamie have a list of all of the artists she manages under users, and then the account switches when she picks one? Or a different way?
- If she switches accounts, does this mean she is in all of those accounts as well?

### Analysis & Recommendations

**Account Structure for Jamie:**

- Jamie is a **member** of multiple accounts (one per artist)
- Each artist has their own account with their own projects
- Jamie switches between accounts to work on different artists

- Works with 8-10 different clients monthly
- Each client has different creative briefs and requirements

### Account Switching Needs 2

**Why Account Switching is Essential:**

- **Client Confidentiality**: Each client's projects must remain private

- **Professional Boundaries**: Clear separation maintains professional relationships

### Typical Workflow 2

1. **Client A Session**: Switches to "PopStar Records" account

### Open Questions 2

- Accounts also have projects. Just because someone is in an account doesn't mean they can see every project. Does this impact Riley?
- Should we better define the function of accounts?

### Analysis & Recommendations 2

**Account vs. Project Hierarchy:**

- **Accounts** = Business/Legal/Contractual boundaries (client, contract, rates)
- **Projects** = Creative work boundaries within accounts (songs, collaborators)

**Riley's Workflow:**

- **Account Switch**: Changes business context (client, contract, royalty rates)

### Account Switching Needs 3

### Open Questions 3

- After an account switch does Casey only see the users in that account? This makes sense, but does that mean there should be an all users view as well?
- I'm not sure how well the app would work in an academic setting, but we should discuss further as how to make this work. Because there are lots of songwriting school programs out there.

### Academic Potential Open Questions

- Originally I was thinking of limiting the amount of collaborators on a song to around 5, but for a classroom setting this may need to be larger.

### Analysis & Recommendations 4

**Classroom Collaboration Scenarios:**

- **Small Groups**: 3-5 students (current limit works)
- **Class Projects**: 10-20 students working on one song

- **Interface Complexity**: UI becomes cluttered with many participants

**Proposed Solutions:**

- **Tiered Limits**: Different limits based on account type (Personal: 5, Educational: 20, Enterprise: 50)
- **Sub-group Sessions**: Break large classes into smaller working groups
- **Asynchronous Collaboration**: Students contribute at different times

- **Batch Processing**: Process contributions in batches rather than real-time

**Educational Features Needed:**

- Are we saying that contract terms and territories are assigned on the account level?
- Are we saying different publishing agreements are on the account level?
  - Keep in mind we also have projects.
    - So if one artist (songwriter) is working on 20 songs with different publishers -- that could be an issue, right?
    - Then an artist (songwriter) would need to switch accounts for every song.
    - 20 different publishers would prob never happen -- but still, it seems having the flexibility would be useful.
