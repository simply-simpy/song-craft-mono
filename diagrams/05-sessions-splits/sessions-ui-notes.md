# Sessions in UI

## Workspace

- Writers see session banner, join link, check in, and the locked split view
- Owners and collaborators can file a contest from the split view

## Song Admin

- Create session, manage invites, attendance, view locked split, view audit for this song
- Account Manager or above can change split (with reason)

## Global Admin

- Session templates, default split policy (even by default), invite domain rules, notification rules
- Org Admin can resolve contests, view global audit, configure who is notified on changes

## Account Switcher Effect

- Switching accounts changes the Global Admin policy context applied to new sessions and who is notified
- The locked split on an existing song remains what it is; only Account Manager or above in that song's account can change it
