# Notes

- Org = the payer/allocator + umbrella brand (what you called “publisher,” but broader).

- Account = the working bucket (Rock, R&B, HipHop, or a soloist’s personal account).

## Roles

- Org Owner/Admin: create/manage Accounts, seat allocation, policies (e.g., domain restrictions).

- Account Manager (within an Org): doles out Pro seats, manages Owners of that Account.

- Owner (Account): creates/deletes songs, invites collaborators, manages that Account’s settings.

- Collaborator (Account): edits/records on granted songs; co-author credit; no create/delete.

## Viewer (Account): read + notes

- Publisher Admins (Org level) don’t edit songs; they have observer views across the Org.
