# Account-Centric Database Migration - ERD Updates

## Overview

Updated all ERD diagrams to reflect the new account-centric database structure where accounts are the top-level entity instead of organizations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Core Identity Structure Changes

**USER Table Updates:**

- Added `global_role` field for system-wide permissions
- Added `last_login_at` timestamp
- Added `account_ids` array for fast access to user's accounts
- Added `primary_account_id` for default account context
- Added `current_account_id` for currently active account context
- Removed `updated_at` (not implemented in actual schema)

**ORG Table Updates:**

- Removed `status` field (not in actual schema)
- Added `billing_email` for org-level billing
- Added `billing_address` for billing address
- Added `billing_phone` for billing contact
- Now focused on billing and management rather than primary entity

**ACCOUNT Table Updates:**

- Added `parent_org_id` as primary relationship to orgs (nullable)
- Kept `org_id` as legacy field (nullable) for backward compatibility
- Added `owner_user_id` for account ownership
- Added `description` for account description
- Added `billing_email` for account-level billing
- Added `settings` (jsonb) for flexible configuration
- Now the top-level entity for collaboration

### 2. Account Context Tracking

**USER_CONTEXT Table (New):**

- Added `user_context` table for tracking which account a user is currently operating under
- Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `current_account_id`, `last_switched_at`, `context_data` (JSONB), `created_at`
- Provides audit trail for account context switches
- Allows flexible context data storage for future features

### 3. Relationship Changes

**Primary Relationships:**

- `ORG ||--o{ ACCOUNT : "parent_org_id (primary)"` - New primary relationship
- `ORG ||--o{ ACCOUNT : "org_id (legacy)"` - Legacy relationship maintained

**User-Account Relationships:**

- `USER ||--o{ ACCOUNT : "primary_account_id"` - User's default account
- `USER ||--o{ ACCOUNT : "current_account_id"` - Currently active account context
- `USER ||--o{ USER_CONTEXT : "has context"` - Tracks user's context history
- `ACCOUNT ||--o{ USER_CONTEXT : "current context"` - Tracks active users in account

**Account-Centric Flow:**

- Users create accounts first
- Accounts can exist without an org (standalone)
- Accounts can optionally belong to an org for billing
- Users are invited to accounts, not orgs directly
- Users can switch between accounts they have access to

### 4. Files Updated

1. **core-identity-erd.mermaid** - Core identity structure
2. **account-user-songs-erd.mermaid** - Main account/song relationships
3. **all-erds.mermaid** - Comprehensive overview
4. **billing-subscriptions-erd.mermaid** - Billing and subscription structure

### 4. Files Not Updated

The following files were not updated as they focus on specific domains that don't directly relate to the core identity structure changes:

- **songs-collab-erd.mermaid** - Song collaboration features
- **access-control-erd.mermaid** - Access control mechanisms
- **comms-notifications-erd.mermaid** - Communications and notifications
- **sessions-splits-erd.mermaid** - Song sessions and splits
- **schema-01-db.mermaid** - Conceptual schema (not implementation-specific)

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Simpler User Onboarding**: Users create accounts first, then optionally join orgs
2. **Account Portability**: Easy to transfer accounts between orgs
3. **Flexible Billing**: Account-level and org-level billing options
4. **Better Collaboration**: Users work in accounts, not orgs
5. **Clearer Permissions**: Account-level roles are more intuitive
6. **Fast Account Access**: `user.accountIds` array provides instant access to all user accounts
7. **Primary Account Context**: `user.primaryAccountId` for default account selection
8. **Current Account Context**: `user.currentAccountId` for active account tracking
9. **Context Switching**: Users can easily switch between accounts they have access to
10. **Audit Trail**: Track when and why users switch account contexts
11. **Efficient Queries**: No JOINs needed for basic account listing

## Migration Notes

- All existing data preserved during migration
- `org_id` field kept for backward compatibility
- `parent_org_id` is now the primary relationship
- Accounts can exist without an org (standalone accounts)
- Billing can be handled at both account and org levels
